[![Email Deliverability](https://img.shields.io/badge/deliverability-optimized-green.svg)]()

A production-ready, enterprise-grade bulk email system built with Python that intelligently manages large-scale email campaigns while maintaining high deliverability rates and respecting provider limits.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system was developed to solve the challenge of sending personalized emails to thousands of recipients while ensuring high deliverability, maintaining sender reputation, and providing robust error handling. Originally built for a nonprofit organization helping students from non-target universities break into top-tier companies.

**Real-world impact**: Successfully manages outreach to 4,000+ students across 200+ universities nationwide.

## 🚀 Key Features & Technical Highlights

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Gmail account with 2FA enabled
- Domain access for SPF/DKIM configuration (optional but recommended)

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-bulk-email-system.git
cd intelligent-bulk-email-system

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas

# Set up environment (recommended)
python setup_env.py

# Run the system
python bulk_email_sender.py
```

## Configuration

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)

The most secure way to configure the script is using environment variables:

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
python setup_env.py
```

**Manual Setup:**

Windows:
```cmd
set SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
set SENDER_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
set SENDER_NAME=Your Name
```

Mac/Linux:
```bash
export SENDER_EMAIL="your_email@gmail.com"
export SENDER_PASSWORD="your_16_character_app_password"
export SENDER_NAME="Your Name"
```

### Option 2: Edit Script Directly

1. Open `bulk_email_sender.py` in a text editor
2. Find lines 41-43 and update:

```python
self.sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"  # Your email address
self.sender_password = "your_app_password"  # Your Gmail App Password
self.sender_name = "Your Name"  # Your name for the sender field
```

### For Gmail Users

1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → App passwords
   - Generate a password for "Mail"
   - Use this app password instead of your regular password

3. Or enable "Less secure app access" (not recommended):
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → Less secure app access → Turn on

## Customizing Email Content

Edit the `create_email_content` method in the script to customize:

- Email subject
- Email body (both text and HTML versions)
- Personalization fields
- Your contact information
- Program details

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Based on production usage with 4,000+ recipients:

| Metric | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Delivery Success Rate** | 95%+ |
| **Processing Speed** | 200 emails/hour (can be increased to howmuch ever desired, but more can get email account banned due to spamming) |
| **Memory Usage** | <50MB for 10K+ emails |
| **Error Recovery** | 99% automatic retry success |
| **Spam Rate** | <2% (with proper domain setup) |

## 💡 Usage Examples

### **Basic Campaign**
```bash
python bulk_email_sender.py
# Select Option 1: Test Mode (sends to 3 recipients)
# Verify delivery and formatting
# Select Option 2: Production Mode
```

### **Advanced Configuration**
```python
# Custom batch processing
sender = BulkEmailSender()
sender.batch_size = 25          # Smaller batches for new domains
sender.delay_between_emails = 5  # Slower sending for better deliverability
sender.daily_limit = 100        # Conservative approach
```

### **Enterprise Integration**
```python
# Integration with external data sources
emails = sender.read_emails_from_multiple_csvs("campaigns/*.csv")
sender.send_bulk_emails(emails, test_mode=False)
```

## CSV File Format

The script automatically detects and handles these CSV formats:

**Format 1: Email only**
```
email1@example.com
email2@example.com
```

**Format 2: Email with additional data**
```
email1@example.com,https://linkedin.com/...
email2@example.com,additional_data
```

**Format 3: With header**
```
Email Address
email1@example.com
email2@example.com
```

## Safety Features

- **Email Validation**: Invalid email formats are automatically filtered out
- **Duplicate Removal**: Duplicate emails are removed automatically
- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: 1-1.5s randomized delays between emails to avoid pattern detection
- **SMTP Connection Reuse**: Single connection per batch reduces server load and throttling
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff for failed sends
- **Daily Limits**: Respects Gmail's 450 emails/day safe limit
- **Intelligent Batch Processing**: 50 emails per batch with connection refresh
- **Test Mode**: Always test with a few emails first
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All activities logged with detailed error handling

## Log Files

The script creates detailed log files with timestamps:
- `email_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

Log files include:
- Success/failure for each email
- Invalid email addresses found
- Overall statistics
- Error messages and debugging information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Error**
   - Check your email and password
   - For Gmail, use App Password instead of regular password
   - Ensure "Less secure app access" is enabled (if not using App Password)

2. **SMTP Connection Error**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify SMTP server settings
   - Some networks block SMTP ports

3. **Emails Not Sending**
   - Check if your email provider has daily sending limits
   - Verify recipient email addresses are valid
   - Check spam folder for test emails

### Gmail Settings

For Gmail users, use these SMTP settings (already configured in the script):
- SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587
- Security: STARTTLS
